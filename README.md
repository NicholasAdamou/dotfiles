# [Nicholas](https://github.com/nicholasadamou)’s Kali-Linux dotfiles

## Setup

[![xkcd: Automation](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png)](http://xkcd.com/1319/)

To install my `dotfiles`, just run the snippet in `terminal` or `terminal`:

(⚠️ **DO NOT** run the `install` snippet if you don't fully
understand [what it does](.dotfiles/tag-kali/.modules/install.sh). Seriously, **DON'T**!)

```bash
bash <(curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholasadamou/dotfiles/kali-linux/.dotfiles/tag-kali/modules/install.sh) --git
```

That's it! ✨
