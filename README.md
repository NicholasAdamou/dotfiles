# [Nicholas](https://github.com/nicholasadamou)’s Kali-Linux dotfiles

Personal Kali-Linux dotfiles, powered by debian-based [nicholasadamou/set-me-up](https://github.com/nicholasadamou/set-me-up/tree/debian) ✨

## Setup

[![xkcd: Automation](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png)](http://xkcd.com/1319/)

To install my `dotfiles`, just run the snippet in `terminal`:

(⚠️ **DO NOT** run the `install` snippet if you don't fully
understand [what it does](.dotfiles/tag-kali/.modules/install.sh). Seriously, **DON'T**!)

```bash
bash <(curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholasadamou/dotfiles/kali-linux/.dotfiles/tag-kali/modules/install.sh) --git
```

⚠️ Please note that more about the installation process can be found at [nicholasadamou/set-me-up](https://github.com/nicholasadamou/set-me-uptree/debian).

That's it! ✨

## What's inside

1.  A `rcm` tag called [macos](.dotfiles/tag-macos) and an adapted `rcrc` file.
2.  [A variety of modules](https://github.com/nicholasadamou/set-me-up/tree/master/.dotfiles/tag-smu/modules). Read more about the available modules in the [available modules](https://github.com/nicholasadamou/set-me-up#available-modules) section.
3.  [Installer](.dotfiles/tag-macos/modules/install.sh) that is required to download `set-me-up` on top of my blueprint.
